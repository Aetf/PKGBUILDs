PKGBUILDs
=========

My customized Arch Linux PKGBUILD files, managed by [aurpublish](https://github.com/eli-schwartz/aurpublish).

### Common tasks

* `aurpublish PACKAGE`

    > Push PACKAGE to the AUR. With "--speedup", merges the split history back in.

* `aurpublish -p PACKAGE`

    > Pull package from the AUR (if you adopted an existing package, or have a co-maintainer).

* `aurpublish log PACKAGE`

    > View the git log of a package subtree.
